# Movie application built with React and TheMovieDb API

This project was created at [Malm√∂ University](https://mau.se/) as part of the course [Web Applications for Mobile Devices](https://edu.mah.se/da344a) by [Aman Zadran](https://github.com/zadama) and [Leonard Granath](https://github.com/Lgk9583).

The project uses [TheMovieDB API](https://developers.themoviedb.org/) to fetch movies in response to the users searches. It is also possible to save your favorite movies and view them later.

### Installation

1. Make sure you have [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm) installed on your machine.
2. `$ git clone https://github.com/zadama/movieapp-project.git`
3. `$ cd movieapp-project`
4. `$ npm install`
5. `$ npm start`

### Choice of technology

Our choice of frameworks was influenced by a number of factors: simplicity, familiarity and popularity. Vue is considered by many to have a lighter learning curve compared to React and Angular, however, that was not exactly the factor that was decisive for our project. We prioritized familiarity and popularity; the choice was therefore React. React is the most popular framework according to Stackoverflow and is also highly sought after in the labor market, slightly behind Angular [1]. Additional factors that influenced our choice were the community and available libraries built for React as well as the amount of material available online.

Furthermore, the code-approach also influenced our choice. Angular may be popular however we found learning Typescript to be a form of disadvantage and difficulty therefore React became the obvious choice. If we compare with Vue.js, we think the approach "everything-javascript" was more fun to work with, which is React, and not the seperation of HTML and Javascript which is Vue [2]. Finally, React.js is a good choice if you want to start developing for mobile applications at a later stage, which is possible with React-native. There are similar solutions in Vue, for example, but they are not nearly as popular and recognized as React-native.
